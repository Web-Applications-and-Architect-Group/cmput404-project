# Set up Enviroment
===================
This section described how to set up your environment in you local computer. The software can only run if your environment set up properly, so be careful of it.

##  Dependency & Tools Installation (First time on your computer)
You can skip this part is you have ```virtualenv```, ```pip```,```python2.7``` installed. If you didn't done that, use the follow cammands to get them install,

### pip
According to this link: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip), 
> pip is already installed if you're using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org, but you'll need to upgrade pip.

the pip is ready for you if you have installed [Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org](#python)

If you haven't get the pip installed (could be test by type `$ pip` in your commend line shell), you can find the instructions for installing and/or upgrading pip in [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Mac users who install Python via [Homebrew](#homebrew-for-mac) will have pip ready to use.

The detail documentation and/or guides of pip could be found in [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)


### Python
We recommend to install Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 

Mac OS X users can also install Python via [Homebrew](#homebrew-for-mac) using this code:
```bash
$ brew install python
```

#### virthualenv (the virtual environment for python)
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```
